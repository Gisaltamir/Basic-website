# HTML + CSS Assignment
HTML CSS Assignment, Metropolia University of Applied Science.

## Tasks
Make a simple website following [this layout](https://github.com/ilkkamtk/html-css-assignment/blob/main/assingment-layout.pdf)

Three pages must be done:
 - Home
 - Products
 - Contact

## Approach

This website is for a company called "Pawsitive Embrace". The company works as a refugee center for animals and it offers people to reserve one hour "hugging sessions". This sessions can be reserved by phone or email and that information can be found in the "Contact Page".
The home site is done with two banners and information about the company, it has a button that takes the user to the Contact page. "Product" page in my case is call "Workers", and it shows all the animals availables to reserve a session with.

*It is not a responsive design, it's just designed to work with laptop default monitor size.
